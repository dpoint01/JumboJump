Game Title: Jumbo Jump
Team: Harry O'Sullivan & David Pointeau 
Date: May 4th, 2014

Jumbo Jump is a classic one-player game in which one's aim is to continue
to rise upward. One can do this by either jumping on a platform or successfully
hitting the stars. The higher you go, the better your score. Stars will also 
further your score, so it is in your advantage to try and hit as many as you
can. 

The controls are simple. Simply tilt your IOS device in the direction that you 
want to proceed. Simply acceloremeter. There are no other controls. 


Please contact me if your are interested in retrieving the files.
I will send you the zip file so it will be easier to run. You simply need the latest version
of Xcode and a apple's developer id.

THE MAIN CODE IS IN: myscene.m

Learning how to program in Objective-C was a challege, and we owe our work to 
numerous tutorials that we found online. In the end, we compiled what we learn-
ed in these tutorials to create our first and simple IOS game. Some of the 
tutorials we looked at were ones by Ray Wenderlich and Ry's Objective-C tutorial.
